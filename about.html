                                <P>My name is mustapha trawally from banjul. I’ve been living there my whole life with my family.
                                I did all my academic career banjul and it has’nt been easy. I am a simple guy who hide a 
                                thousand feelings behind beautiful smiles. I love talking and smiling especially when am with
                                 my friends, family and oved ones because having the talent of putting smile on people’s faces
                                  even at their dark moments makes me feel good. I want to a person who is able to heal a room 
                                  whenever am in it. I am a kind of a person who loves having fun all the time and live every 
                                  little time Allah has blessed me with cuz life is too short to be stressing for unnecessary
                                   things. The truth is , am not a perfect person. I’ve done a lot hell of mistakes but
                                    I apreciate those who stayed with me after knowing how I really am because when I was
                                     a little bit younger I was very fooling and selfish and thoughtless. All I do was
                                      following girls around town, partyinG with bad friends and doing so many bad things.
                                       Life is a journey with it’s destination. You have to enjoy the journey because a lot
                                        of us delay our happiness when I get to this level, when I get to this degree,
                                         when I get the kids, when I get married I’ll be happy. As a human being, you have 
                                         to enjoy every step everyday that you get up to strive for whatever youre after and
                                          you know am a goal-oriented guy. You don’t celebrate when you get to the finish line.
                                           Celebrate all along the way. Love yourself to have a meaningful life.
                                            I have a dream of becoming a multi-bilionaire someday I don’t know when but
                                             I know I’ll make it. Am always careful with who I share my dream with and the
                                              voices I listen to, everybody don’t have my best of interest at heart. Not 
                                              everybody want to see me success, some people like me better broken, 
                                              they secretlywanna get pleasure from my struggle and these people be sadly 
                                              discouraged by the level of faith that is about to overtake my life in shaa allah.
                                               I always help out people emotionally, physically and mentally
                                                because I believe am a good person with a golden heart.
                                                </P>

                                <P>My passion has always been desling with computing devices sincee when I was in primary school.
                                    I discovered what I really wanted my future to be like the moment I was givin a chance to type
                                     on a computer along side with my classmates. A half page was given to us all and I came to be
                                      the first person to be done with the typing in just few munites. My passion is to study 
                                      computer networking, web designing and database development , in short I want all the 
                                      threeat the same time because I want to become a valueable asset not just in my community
                                       but in anywhere I go. I amconfident to believe that I can do it but my problem at the 
                                       moment is motivation and inspiration which I am badly in need of . building a career
                                        isn’t about how people see things and believe that’s where success is, but instead it’s 
                                        about how you give out yourself to the world to se what you are truly good at and love
                                         doing it. In other words I would say doing what makes you happy and makes you feel like 
                                         you have a place in this world is what’s worth sacrificing for . I know distraction is 
                                         all around me with the big dream I have but that won’t stop me from trying to be who am 
                                         destined to be. I hope and pray that some day I change the lifestyle of my family 
                                         expecially my mom and dad , I just wish that someday I make them proud of me someday 
                                         because I owe it to them big time . lots of sacrifices have been made by them andd cannot
                                          be paid back , so the only chance I gat is to build up my life to be like my father,
                                           strong, gentle, hardworking, confident, dedicated, kind and caring man in shaa allah.
                                       </P>
